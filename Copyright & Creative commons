<h1 style="text-align:center;">Copyright</h1>
<p>What is copyright?</p>
<p>Copyright refers to the legal right of the owner of intellectual property. In simpler terms, copyright is the right to copy.</p>
<p>What can I use freely without worrying about copyright?</p>
<p>As a general rule, most works enter the public domain because of old age, such as any work published in the United States before January 1, 1925. Another large block of works are in the public domain because they were published before 1964 and their copyright was not renewed.</p>
<p>That is where creative commons comes in. </p>
<p>It is a license that gives everyone from individual creators to large institutions a standardized way to grant the public permission to use their creative work under copyright law.</p>

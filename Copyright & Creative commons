<h1 style="text-align:center;">Copyright</h1>
<p>What can I use freely without worrying about copyright?</p>
<p>As a general rule, most works enter the public domain because of old age, such as any work published in the United States before January 1, 1925. Another large block of works are in the public domain because they were published before 1964 and their copyright was not renewed.</p>

<p style="font-family:courier;">After reading the article, I now understand the basis of RPA (Robotic Process Automation). It's software that uses bots to automate repetitive tasks. I'm not the only one who thinks this, companies are flocking to this software only because it can streamline operations, enhance accuracy, reduce costs, improve customer service, and enable employees to focus on strategic tasks. Another reason is its costs, which vary between the complexity of the tasks, the quantity of bots, and the platform that's used. Moreover, its ROI is often realized quickly due to efficiency gains.</p>

<p style="font-family:courier;">Will it be popular, I say yes. Since it's software that can complete repetitive tasks people can focus their work on something else.</p>
